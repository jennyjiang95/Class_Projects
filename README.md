#This is a showcase of my class projects.

### 1. Life Expectancy VS Income 1880-2015
Intrigued by [Hans Rosling's project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo), I recreated a similar graph using R.

###### Language: R (Shiny app; ggplot2)

### 2. Visualizing Berkeley Police Data
For the STAT 133 final project, our group was interested in finding some ways of visualizing the relationship
between the Berkeley Police Department and different groups of people, especially within the context of different
populations and neighborhoods within Berkeley.
###### Language: R (ggplot2, map); Google Map API

### 3. Different word choices across US States
Interested in languages, I used the dataset from [a Dialect Survey conducted by Bert Vaux](http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/index.html) to create this map. 
###### Language: R (ggplot2, Shiny app, map)

### 4. Bay Area Public Bike Usage v. The Weather
The purpose of this project is to conduct an open preliminary review and analysis of accumulated data sourced directly from a local bicycle rental service called Bay Area Bike Share and find correlations between bike share activity and weather conditions using the data.
###### Language: Python (numpy, panda, ggplot2)

### 5. Bank Account (Python: Objective-Oriented Language)
This is a class project to show my understanding of python as an objective-oriented language. This Bank Account program is to allow user to manage their account in the bank. 
###### Language: Python
