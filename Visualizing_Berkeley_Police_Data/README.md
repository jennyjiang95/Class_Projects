# STAT 133 Final Project: Visualizing Berkeley Police Data

For the STAT 133 final project, our group was interested in finding some ways of visualizing the relationship
between the Berkeley Police Department and different groups of people, especially within the context of different
populations and neighborhoods within Berkeley. 

To obtain our results, we accessed, cleaned and explored the four Berkeley Police Department data sets available to the public on the Berkeley Open Data website using R,
the statistical programming language. These data sets were of police stops, calls for service, arrests, and jail
bookings. There were 16,255 stops (including stops for traffic, suscpicious vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian)
from a 16-month period that began on January 26, 2015 (in compliance with General Order B-4, which ordered
this data set to be collected for the public) and ending on April 30th, 2016. The calls of service included 4,911
calls, which were collected over the most recent a 6-month period, from January 20, 2016 to July 13, 2016.
The arrest data included 232 arrests from the previous 1-month period, from June 20, 2016 to July 19, 2016.
The jail bookings data set included 248 jail bookings over the same 1-month period. In addition to the police
data, we accessed the Berkeley city and the Alameda County 2010 census data in order to obtain demographic
information about Berkeley as a whole and about the demographics of the neighborhoods inside of Berkeley.
The three census data sets that we used are also available through Berkeley’s open data site, including the
Berkeley 2000-2010 census data, which gave us the total population counts and percentages of each group of
people in Berkeley for the 2010 census, the Alameda County 2010 census tract population data, which gave us
the demographic information for 33 different neighborhoods (or “tracts”) inside Berkeley, and the Berkeley
2010 census tract polygons shapefile (.shp), which provided the information we needed to visually display the
33 neighborhoods. Rather than limiting the project to one set of data, incorporating multiple data sets gave us
a more holistic understanding of subject and expanded our ability to understand and visualize the data. 

## Our findings suggest the hypothesis that (1) black people in Berkeley are more likely than members of another
group of people to be stopped by Berkeley police, and that (2) black people in Berkeley are arrested and jailed
at disproportionate rates. We recommend future statistical analysis be done to test our hypothesis.
