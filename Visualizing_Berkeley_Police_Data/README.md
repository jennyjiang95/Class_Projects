# STAT 133 Final Project: Visualizing Berkeley Police Data

For the STAT 133 final project, our group was interested in finding some ways of visualizing the relationship between the Berkeley Police Department and different groups of people, especially within the context of different populations and neighborhoods within Berkeley. 

To obtain our results, we accessed, cleaned and explored the four Berkeley Police Department data sets available to the public on the Berkeley Open Data website using R, the statistical programming language. These data sets were of police stops, calls for service, arrests, and jail bookings. 

For overall findings, please look at the final paper (pdf). The RMD file contains the codes of generating the plots. The *eda folder* is data exploration. The *clean_data* folder is how we cleaned the data.

Our findings suggest the hypothesis that (1) black people in Berkeley are more likely than members of another
group of people to be stopped by Berkeley police, and that (2) black people in Berkeley are arrested and jailed
at disproportionate rates. We recommend future statistical analysis be done to test our hypothesis.
